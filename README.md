This is a Python Flask Fullstack Project initiated by the Software Enginnering students of ALX AJAH, as a series that ran through different episodes of their PLD sessions. 

This project contains the fullsetup of a Flask application: how to set it up, how to run it, how to setup the file directory, setup Blueprints, setup HTML templates and the corresponding images, css and js files.

Included are files demonstrating how to setup the models for the backend of the application.

The project in context is a blogging app for ALX learners and fellows and facilitates the sharing of their experiences and feedbacks.

This Project was started in July 2024. And would terminate by September 2024.
